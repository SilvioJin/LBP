LaPlaceBeltrami - Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry

This repo contains the work from the second project of the Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry 2018-2019 (UCL MSc CGVI).

The project computes the La-Place Beltrami operator and applies it in different tasks:

- Spectral Analysis
- Smoothing (explicit and implicit)
